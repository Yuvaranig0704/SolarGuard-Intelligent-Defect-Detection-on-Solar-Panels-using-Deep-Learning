# SolarGuard-Intelligent-Defect-Detection-on-Solar-Panels-using-Deep-Learning
🔍 Overview
SolarGuard is a deep learning-based solution aimed at automating the detection of defects on solar panels. By classifying images and localizing issues like dust, bird droppings, and damage, the system helps reduce maintenance costs and improve energy efficiency.

🚀 Project Objectives
1. Classification Task
Classify images of solar panels into one of six categories:

Clean

Dusty

Bird-Drop

Electrical-Damage

Physical-Damage

Snow-Covered

2. Object Detection Task (Optional)
Detect and localize defects using bounding boxes:

Dust

Bird-Drop

Electrical-Damage

Physical-Damage
